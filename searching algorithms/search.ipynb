    "\n",
    "QuickSort is a sorting algorithm based on the Divide and Conquer that picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot by placing the pivot in its correct position in the sorted array.\n",

    "Time Complexity\n",

    "\n",
    "Worst Case: (O(n²)), Occurs when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot (e.g., sorted arrays).\n",

    "####  Advantages of Quick Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that makes it easier to solve problems.\n",

    "It has a low overhead, as it only requires a small amount of memory to function.\n",

    "\n",
    "Fastest general purpose algorithm for large data when stability is not required.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is tail recursive and hence all the tail call optimization can be done.\n",

    "#### Disadvantages of Quick Sort\n",
    "It has a worst-case time complexity of O(n2), which occurs when the pivot is chosen poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not a good choice for small data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not a stable sort, meaning that if two elements have the same key, their relative order will not be preserved in the sorted output in case of quick sort, because here we are swapping elements according to the pivot’s position (without considering their original positions).\n",

    "#### Applications of Quick Sort\n",
    "Efficient for sorting large datasets with O(n log n) average-case time complexity.\n",
